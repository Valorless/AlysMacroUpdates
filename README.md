# Aly's Macro Updates
AMU automatically update specific macros, such as a covenant macro changing to match your current class and covenant. Or a macro to cast Misdirect or Earth Shield on the tank, without having to set them as focus or target.

*Why have multiple macros for the same thing?*

Macros have to be added by yourself, and will update every time you log in, your group changes, or your covenant changes.
You can also update it yourself using the command **/amu update**.

You can view all available macros in-game using the command **/amu macros**.

You can always disable AMU using the command **/amu toggle**.

Do note that some macros were made for 5-man groups, but can still work in raids under certain circumstances.

 

Current Macros:

 - '**AMU_Covenant**', Updates the macro to your class' covenant ability. Changes when you swap covenant.

Currently supports: Death Knight, Shaman, Paladin, Priest.

 - '**AMU_Covenant2**', Signature covenant ability, changes when you swap covenants.

 - '**AMU_EarthShield**', Casts Earth Shield on tank. If no tank is found, cast on focus, or self if no focus.

(Can't find tanks in raid, unless a tank is in your specific group.)

 - '**AMU_PW-Shield**', Casts Power Word: Shield on tank. If no tank is found, cast on focus, or self if no focus.

(Can't find tanks in raid, unless a tank is in your specific group.)

 - '**AMU_Misdirect**', Casts Misdirection on tank. If no tank is found, cast on focus. If no focus is found, cast on friendly target, or pet if no target.

(Can't find tanks in raid, unless a tank is in your specific group.)

 - '**AMU_Interrupt**', Casts interrupt on focus, if focus is hostile. If no focus is found, cast on target instead.

 

By default, 2 macros will be created:

 - '**AMU_AutoLoot**', Toggles whether auto looting is enabled.

 - '**AMU_ScriptErrors**', Toggles whether script errors should appear.
